# Tennis Simulator

This is a basic REPL script that simulates points in tennis using a Bernoulli trial system. Each point, the server can win the point with probability `n` and the returner can win the point with probability `1-n`. We can use either best of 3 sets scoring or Grand Slam scoring (best of 5 sets).
